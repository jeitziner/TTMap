# TTMap
R Software Package
Written by Rachel Jeitziner

We have developed a topology-based analytical framework called Two-Tier Mapper (TTMap) which identifies distinct subgroups in global gene expression datasets and determines their distinguishing features. 
It is written as a package for R any information can be found in the folder man or in the vignettes folder.

The paper comprising theory and analysis of the method are submitted on the arxiv referenced by Rachel Jeitziner, Mathieu Carri√®re,  Jacques Rougemont, Steve Oudot, Kathryn Hess, and Cathrin Brisken, Two-Tier Mapper: a user-independent clustering method for global gene expression analysis based on topology, 2017.
